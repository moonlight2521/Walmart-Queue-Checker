## FAQ

**Q: Does the auto-refresh reload the whole browser?**
**A:** Yes. The timer syncs across all open tabs and windows using Chrome's storage. When the time arrives, *all* tabs with the extension active will reload simultaneously. This uses the browser's shared storage to ensure every instance is ready.

**Q: Should I use a proxy for multiple windows?**
**A:** Yes. If you are running multiple instances (especially with the same IP), Walmart may flag your traffic. Using proxies for separate windows/profiles is recommended to avoid IP bans. I recommend [BP Proxy Switcher](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bp-proxy-switcher/bapeomcobggcdleohggighcjbeeglhbn?hl=en) for easy proxy management.
